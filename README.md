# astro-3d-game
Fix your crashed spaceship! a small 3d game using a simple game engine created with OpenGL, GLSL & C++

# GAMEPLAY
- The game starts with a cutscene following our ship before the crash.
- After the crash happens we pass to the scene of the planet we crashed in, the world contains a terrain surrounded by water and mountains,
we see another planet far away.
- The user can move and rotate using the WASD & arrow keys.
- The user has 6 tasks to complete in order to finish the game:
  1. "You've crashed your spaceship, find tool to fix it. Press P to pickup item"
  2. "You found your tool, use it to fix your spaceship. Press Q for repair"
  3. "Your ship is repaired but it still needs fuel, mine minerals to create bucket. Press Q to mine"
  4. "Here's your bucket, use it to collect fuel. Press P to pickup and collect"
  5. "Fuel collected, go to your spaceship to refill it. Press Q to refill"
  6. "You're ready to go home! Press space to fly home"

# GUI
each task is shown sequentially in the GUI created using DEAR IMGUI, we can also turn on\off our skybox using the GUI (only after the cutscene).

# CONCLUSION
The main scope of this project was to learn how Computer graphics work and how other big game engines are developed.
